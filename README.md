# scrape-app
This repo holds a web app built with streamlite intended on scraping info like business name, address, city, state, ZIP, phone number, and email from a website.

## make it work
to make the app in this repo actually work you need to make a file in the same directory as the res of the files called "api_key.py" and put in the file an api key in the format "api_key = 'THIS-IS-THE-KEY'". 
from there you can cd into the directory in the command line and then run "sreamlit run app.py" or just make an alias of the file app.command and drag that to your desktop to create a clickable "app".
